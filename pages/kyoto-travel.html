            <h2>Top Attractions:</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Fushimi Inari Shrine: Famous for its thousands of red torii
                gates, Fushimi Inari Shrine is an iconic symbol of Kyoto.
                Visitors can hike the scenic path up Mount Inari, passing
                through endless rows of vibrant gates, and enjoy panoramic views
                of the city. The shrine itself is dedicated to Inari, the Shinto
                god of rice and prosperity.
              </li>
              <li>
                Kinkaku-ji (Golden Pavilion): A stunning Zen temple covered in
                gold leaf, Kinkaku-ji reflects beautifully on its surrounding
                pond. Originally a retirement villa for a shogun, it was
                converted into a temple and is now one of Kyoto's most visited
                sites. The meticulously maintained gardens and the peaceful
                setting make it a must-see.
              </li>
              <li>
                Arashiyama Bamboo Grove: A serene forest of towering bamboo
                stalks, the Arashiyama Bamboo Grove provides a tranquil escape
                from the city. Walking through the grove feels like stepping
                into another world, with the rustling of bamboo leaves creating
                a soothing soundtrack. Nearby, the Tenryu-ji Temple and the
                Okochi-Sanso Villa offer further exploration opportunities.
              </li>
              <li>
                Gion District: Known for its traditional wooden machiya houses,
                Gion is Kyoto's famous geisha district. Visitors can explore
                historic teahouses, enjoy performances of traditional arts, and
                possibly spot a geisha or maiko (apprentice geisha) in full
                attire. The district comes alive at night with lantern-lit
                streets and vibrant cultural activities.

                Kiyomizu-dera Temple, Eikando Temple, and Tofuku-ji Temple. The

            <h2>Travel Tips:</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Getting Around: Utilize Kyoto's efficient public transportation
                system. The city's extensive bus and subway networks make it
                easy to reach major attractions. Consider purchasing a Kyoto
                City Bus & Kyoto Bus One-Day Pass for unlimited travel within
                the city.
              </li>
              <li>
                Cultural Etiquette: Respect local customs, such as bowing and
                removing shoes in certain areas. When visiting temples and
                shrines, be mindful of dress codes and behave respectfully.
                Learning a few basic phrases like "Arigato" (thank you) and
                "Sumimasen" (excuse me) can go a long way in enhancing your
                interactions with locals.
              </li>
              <li>
                Language: Learning basic Japanese phrases can enhance your
                experience. While many people in Kyoto understand some English,
                speaking a bit of Japanese shows respect and can help you
                navigate more easily. Carry a phrasebook or translation app to
                assist with communication.
